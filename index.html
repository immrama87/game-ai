    <div class="container">
      <p>Welcome to Learning By Doing, a "blog" documenting my attempts to better learn the concepts behind designing game AI by going back to square one and designing AIs for games of increasing complexity.</p>
      <p>The goal will be to present each project with all of the pitfalls that were encountered, as well as the thought process behind overcoming the pitfall. Some of these pitfalls will be "simulated" in the sense that they may seem overly simple to predict and avoid, but the intention in including these is that I don't want to gloss over my assumptions as they will almost certainly become less obvious as the complexity of the AIs grows and having a documented thought process will be very valuable.</p>
      <p>New articles will be released when projects are created and the HTML demos are ready but, for the impatient, the README.md for an in-progress project will be updated as progress is made. So, without further ado, here's the list of completed projects as well as their demos:</p>
      <h1 class="display-4">Projects:</h1>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="1-tictactoe">Tic Tac Toe</a></li>
      </ol>

      <h1 class="display-4">Demos:</h1>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="1-tictactoe/demo">Tic Tac Toe</a></li>
